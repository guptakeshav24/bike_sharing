# Bike Sharing

BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has faced revenue declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic and seeks to develop a data-driven strategy to recover post-lockdown. 
To achieve this, they aim to understand the key factors influencing **shared bike demand** and how well these factors explain demand variations.
A consulting firm has been engaged to analyze a large dataset of daily bike rentals, incorporating meteorological and behavioral factors, 
to help BoomBikes optimize its business strategy and gain a competitive edge.

# _Statement_
The objective of this assignment is to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. 
The primary goal is to identify the key variables that significantly impact bike demand and analyze how well these variables explain the variations in demand. 
The insights from this model will help the bike-sharing provider optimize its business strategy and better meet customer needs.

# _Conclusion_
- The most influential variables are **atemp, yr, and season_winter**.
- The **R-squared value** for the final model is **0.85 on the training set** and **0.83 on the test set**.
- The **error terms follow a normal distribution** and exhibit **constant variance**.
